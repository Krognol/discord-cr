# discord-cr

A Discord library for Crystal!

Still needs some refinement. What you see is not the final product.

Still a WIP. Use at your own risk. Should at least be funcitonal now.

## Installation


Add this to your application's `shard.yml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  discord-cr:
    github: Krognol/discord-cr
```


## Usage


```crystal
require "discord-cr"

# Note that the "Bot " part is very important
client = Discord::Client.new("regular token", "Bot token")
client.botLogin # Requires no arguments
# alternatively you can use 
# client.emailLogin("your email here", "your l33t p4ssword here")

# register an event
client.on_message_create do |message|
  puts message.content
end

client.connect
# better documentation will come later ðŸ‘Œ
```
